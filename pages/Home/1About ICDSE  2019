The rapid development of computer science and information technology in the last couple of decades has generated massive amount of data and fundamentally changed every field in science and engineering. Many disciplines are now rich in data and tend to adopt data science or data-intensive engineering methodologies to do research and development. Scientific approach to process data involving the engineering aspects as well, would lead to major strides in the domains of data, information and knowledge which contribute to the evolving knowledge society. This conference is intended to take stock of the trends and developments in the globally competititve environment as well as to provide indicators for future directions to researchers and practitioners

The conference will include a peer reviewed program of technical sessions, workshops, tutorials, and demonstration sessions. This conference provides a forum for leading experts from  the Data Science, embedded systems programming and high-performance computing community to present their latest research, exchange ideas, and conduct brainstorming applications. ICDSE-2019 has a special theme this year, that is  "Data, Devices, Decisions  for a Digital World". This is particularly relevant considering the fact that it  is being held in IIT Patna, India.  <br>
