The objective of the  International Conference on Data Science and Engineering (ICDSE 2019)is to provide a congenial yet serious platform for experts from academia and industry to interact with young researchers in Data Science and Engineering. This is an interdisciplinary conference that aims at diverse fields of  Science, engineering and technology with a focus on  data analytics  and  smart systems design and development. The major attempt of the conference is to bring out this event to be a forum for researchers and practitioners to come together from all different fields of study such as Mechanical, Electrical, Environmental, Chemical, Electronics and Computer Engineering to foster the needs of data processing in modern human life.   ICDSE 2019 welcomes submissions that have not been published and that are not under review by another conference or journal. All submissions will be evaluated on their originality, technical soundness, significance, presentation, and interest to the conference attendees.

Paper Submission
All full papers submitted will be subjected to a review process through an international review panel. Comments of the reviewers will be directed to the authors prior to the Camera Ready Paper Submission deadline so that they can be accommodated in the camera ready papers.
The Full paper format is IEEE style.

Submissions should not exceed 6 pages and should be formated in the standard IEEE format available at
